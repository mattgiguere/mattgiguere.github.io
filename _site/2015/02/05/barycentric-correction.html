    <h1 class="post-title">The CHIRON Barycentric Correction</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Feb 5, 2015</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>When using the radial velocity method to search for planets orbiting
nearby stars, the dominant signal is always due to the Earth’s motion
about the barycenter of the solar system. Our annual orbit induces
a signal of 30,000 m/s. Furthermore, as the observatory rotates towards
the star, the Earth’s rotation can induce a maximumradial velocity of 400 m/s.
If we didn’t correct for these two effects, we would find all sorts of celestial
bodies with annual and daily orbits. But to find low mass planets, there are
all sorts of other motions and effects that need to be taken into account. For
example, if we didn’t account for the presence of Jupiter, we would see a 12 m/s
signal with a period of approximately 12 years. For each spectroscopic observation
we take, we calculate a precise photon-weighted midpoint of the observation, and
then calculate a barycentric correction to subtract from the Doppler measurement.
This barycentric correction takes into account the relative motions of all the
planets and many minor bodies in the Solar System, the position of the observatory
on Earth, leap seconds due to events such as storms and earth quakes on Earth that
speed up or slow down the Earth’s rotation, etc. For a great description of all that
goes into the barycentric correction, see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4774">Barycentric Corrections at 1 cm/s for precise Doppler velocities</a> by Wright &amp; Eastman (2014).</p>

<p>The other day I noticed a rather interesting correlation between the radial velocity
measurements and the barycentric correction. It can be seen in the following plot, which
shows the RV Measurements as a function of the Barycentric Correction.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Show_RvVsBary2Years.png" alt="RV Measurements as a Function of Barycentric Correction" /></p>

<p>In red are Doppler measurements based on CHIRON observations of Tau Ceti in 2014, and in blue are
the same, but based on 2012 data. While the correlation is not perfect, it’s quite clear in
a few regions (e.g, &lt; -20,000 m/s, and between -8,000 m/s and 0 m/s). This can be
seen a little more clearly by applying a running mean to the data, which
can be seen at the solid lines in the following figure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Show_RvVsBary2YearsBoxcar.png" alt="Same as above, but with a running mean" /></p>

<p>This signal is not really periodic, so it’s most likely not due to a planet in a perfect harmonic
with the Earth’s orbit, and I also wouldn’t expect it to be due to an issue with the barycentric
correction for the same reason. However, we want to make sure we have the best barycentric
correction possible so that we can find genuine low mass planets and not harmonics of a
poor treatment of the motions of celestial bodies in our Solar System. A simple first step was
to replace our current barycentric correction code with the improved code by the above mentioned
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..838W">Wright &amp; Eastman (2014)</a>. So I downloaded
<a href="http://astroutils.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/exofast/">their code</a>, and all the dependencies,
setup Launch Daemon scripts to check for daily updates for leap seconds and so forth, and
recalculated the barycentric corrections for all of our velocity measurements. The result
was an RMS for the Tau Ceti RV time series that was 30 cm/s greater than the RMS from the previous
code.</p>

<p>I then started looking into everything that could be wrong. I double-checked that the coordinates
I was using were the most accurate. For Tau Ceti this required checking the RA, dec, proper motions,
and parallax were all from the
<a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/hipnewcat.html"><em>Hipparcos</em> New Astrometric Catalog</a>
(<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?2007A&amp;A...474..653V">van Leeuwen (2007)</a>). The whole
catalog can be found online on the Vizier site. The data for Tau Ceti in particular can be found
<a href="http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-5?-ref=VIZ54d3a7714f13&amp;-out.add=.&amp;-source=I/311/hip2&amp;recno=8087">here</a>.
For CTIO, the most precise coordinates for the 1.5 m were measured by
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1616">Mamajek (2012)</a>. I was indeed already using the most up to date
coordinates.</p>

<p>I then decided maybe we can do better than these measurements. We have this great time series of
precise RV measurements. Can you we use those measurements to infer a more accurate position of
the observatory here on Earth and a more accurate position and relative motions for Tau Ceti? I
thought it’d be worth a shot, so I setup <a href="http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/">emcee</a> on several
machines in our group cluster, got MPI running on all the machines, and thought I’d try calculating
more accurate hyperparameters through sampling the posterior PDF.</p>

<p>For priors for the observatory position I used Gaussians that were centered on the Mamjek values
and had a standard deviations that were a factor of a few larger than the standard deviation
of the previously measured values. These priors are shown below, where the vertical blue lines
show previously published results, and the red lines show the resulting priors.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Show_ObservatoryPriors.png" alt="CTIO 1.5 m Observatory Coordinate Priors" /></p>

<p>For the priors for the coordinates and motions of Tau Ceti I again used Gaussians centered on
the <em>Hipparcos</em> data with standard deviations a few times those of their reported uncertainties.
These can be seen below, where the values and uncertainties from the intial reduction are shown
in blue, and values and uncertainties from the new reduction mentioned above are shown in yellow,
and the priors used are shown in red.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Show_TauCetiCoordsPriors.png" alt="CTIO 1.5 m Observatory Coordinate Priors" /></p>

<p>After some tweaking, the 100 walkers had a nice spread in their intial values to properly probe
the parameter space within a reasonable number of steps. The resulting chains for each parameter
as a function of step number can be seen below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Show_Chains.png" alt="MCMC Chains" /></p>

<p>I then said the burn-in period completed in about 200 steps, cut those out, and below are the
resulting distributions from sampling the posterior.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Show_TriCornerCoords.png" alt="Triangle Plot Showing PDFs" /></p>

<p>The median values for each parameter were then fed into <code>barycorr</code>. This reduced the RMS, but
still not below the value from the old barycorr.</p>
