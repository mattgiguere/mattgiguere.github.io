Continuing from where I left off last time, I tested out a
three spot model today. Here's the Maximum Likelihood solution
for the two spot model in two dimensions:

![Two Spot Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/TwoSpotModel.png)

where I used an Aitoff projection to show the spot locations
and relative sizes. And here's the three spot solution:

![Three Spot Model]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Show_ThreeSpotModel.png)

Note that the two rightmost spots in the three spot solution are very
similar in size to the rightmost spot in the two spot solution.
