The Yale Astronomy Department is putting together a video showcasing some of
the work going on in the department. All of the parts recently arrived for the
Moletai Astronomical Observatory (MAO) Spectrograph that our group is
building. The timing seems perfect, so the videographer in charge setup a
couple cameras to capture the initial build of the spectrograph.
