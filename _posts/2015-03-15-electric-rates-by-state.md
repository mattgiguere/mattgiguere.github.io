I was talking with my mother-in-law the other day, and we were wondering what
the highest electric rates in the country are. The US Energy Information
Administration does an excellent job of collecting this information and
displaying it in tabular form on their website. Click [here][eiamon] to see
what the answer is for the latest month. However, there is enough data there
that it took me a few minutes to skim through the table to get the answer. To
our surprise, Hawai'i has a far higher electric rate than any other state ---
twice the electric rate of California!
