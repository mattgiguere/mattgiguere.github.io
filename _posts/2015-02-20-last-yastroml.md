Yesterday we concluded [YastroML][YastroML], the Yale astronomy Machine
Learning Discussion Group. Over the past year we have been irregularly meeting
to go over the newly released textbook [Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine
Learning in Astronomy][astromltxt]: a textbook that, as its name implies, goes
over a variety of statistical, data mining, and machine learning techniques
that are relevant to astronomy. As I was looking into ordering the book, I
noticed on twitter that a group of people at Columbia and other institutions
in NYC had started up a discussion group to go over the material, which they
referred to as [NYCastroML][NYCastroML]. This sounded like a terrific idea, and
I immediately decided that I'd try to take part in this weeklyish events. I
started crafting an email to inform other people in the Yale astronomy
Department about the event, and my list of people to include grew, and grew,
and grew... I decided that instead I'd send an email out to the department
to gauge interest in organizing something here at Yale. The response was
overwhelming --- YastroML was born.
