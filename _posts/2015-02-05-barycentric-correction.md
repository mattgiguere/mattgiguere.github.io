I noticed a rather interesting correlation between the radial velocity
measurements and the barycentric correction. For a great description
of what the barycentric correction is and why we need it, see [Barycentric
Corrections at 1 cm/s for precise Doppler velocities](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4774)
by Wright & Eastman (2014).
