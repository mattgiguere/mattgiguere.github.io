  Hi, I'm Matt Giguere, a graduate student searching for rocky
  planets and characterizing stellar activity of the stars
  that host them. In addition to working towards the discovery 
  of other rocky worlds, I am constantly working to defend my best dad 
  of the year title. I also enjoy learning new programming languages, 
  statistical methods, and visualization tools, and all around making 
  things.
